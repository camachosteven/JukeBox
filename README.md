# JukeBox
This Jukebox was created to simulate Spotify, where you list albums and can list their songs information. 

Starting off with the server, I used Express and Axios to create the app and call the APIs to receive the music data. Once data is received and parsed, the server responds with a page containing the 5 albums in the form of a carousel as well as the current album's songlist. You will see visual changes on the individual songs when you hover. You can move to the next album using the arrows. Clicking the arrows will trigger a transition in the carousel from one album to the next along with the old songlist collapsing and the new songlist expanding. 

This project started as a coding challenge from haku Sports. It has been a great experience and want to thank them for this opportunity.
